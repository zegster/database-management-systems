# Project 1 - Manage Data in University Database

DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I will use the following university database (link to the university database) to help you with 
this project assignment. In this programming project, we will practice several basic features both in 
SQL and web programming.

We will practice the following features in this project:
	A. SQL Features
		1. Basic Select statements
		2. Insert new data into the tables.
		3. Update old data in the tables based on the row numbers.
		4. Delete records from the tables based on the row numbers.
		5. Find the primary key of the current table through information_schema.
		
	B. Web Programming Features
		1. Use Bootstrap (Glyphicons) on the buttons.
		2. Use CSS to adjust the styles of GUI components.
		3. Pass data through hidden parameters.
		4. Invoke PHP programs from JavaScript functions.
		5. Change GUI components using JavaScript functions.
		6. Send data to the server through HTML forms or parameters.
		7. Use a uniformed way to access data in different tables
		8. Use a single file for all tables. For instance index.php is used to dispaly all tables.


REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database
	- We will use the university database. In this database, there are 5 tables: course, grade_report, 
		section, prerequisite, and student. From the SQL script, you can see that three tables have a 
		primary key: course, section, and student. The remaining two tables do not have any primary key. 
		How do we identify the records in them?
	- Note: We cannot modify the tables.
	
Enter data
	- We need to insert new records into each table through a simple User Interface.

Switch tables
	- Click the hyperlink of a table to switch to it, then you can enter data in this table through a 
		similar interface.
	
Data validation not required
	- In order to make our first project as simple as possible, we assume that all the data entered is 
		valid. We will leave the data validation part to our second project.
		
Sort the tables based on the selected column
	- You can use the arrow buttons at the bottom of each column to sort the data.

Edit a row in any table
	- When you click the Edit button associated with each row, you can see that the old values are 
		displayed at the bottom of the table.

Delete a row in any table
	- When you click the Delete button associated with each row, you delete the row immediately.
	
[BONUS]
	- Build an admin interface that allows changes in the table structure. For instance, if we would 
		like to edit table STUDENT to include a dependant contact number. Make sure that you can also 
		insert values to all entries if necessary. If you have questions, regarding the requirements 
		for this bonus, do not hesitate to contact me.
	- Note: added a keyword-based search feature. Searching functionality will search all the content
		of the selected table.
	

HOW TO RUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Enable Apache and MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel (v7.4.2 or above).
2. Head to phpMyAdmin main page: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php
3. Click on SQL tab and run [init.sql] (file is in in db folder) by copy and paste into the text field and click on "Go".
4. Now you can view the website in your browser (example URL: http://localhost/database-managment-systems/project-1/index.php)
5. Make sure your browser have JavaScript enable.
